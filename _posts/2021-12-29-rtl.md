I love to find creative ways to use old gadgets. I have this old Oregon Scientific wireless weather forecaster (model BAR888RA) that I bought about 15 years ago. It's moved with us three times, from Oregon to Indiana to New Hampshire, and it continues to just work. Only once in a while I have to recharge its AA batteries. That's quality.

# SDR

After playing with Bluetooth controlled temperature and humidity sensors mentioned in the [previous post](https://cvicente.github.io/homeassistant/2021/09/24/ESP32.html), I thought that it would be fun to integrate
the Oregon Scientific into HomeAssistant too. If it's radio-controlled, someone must have found a way to capture and
decode the radio signals. Sure enough, they have.

That's how I learned about [Software Defined Radio (SDR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio), and more
specifically, the [rtl_433 project](https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433). After a little bit of research, I bought myself the
[Nooelec NESDR Smart v4 Bundle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GDN1T4S/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_NK3RNE3XMYSKTB3JC17J) to play with.

The SDR USB dongle works great. I tried it on my Macbook with the [CubicSDR](https://cubicsdr.com/) app, and was able to listen to FM radio. I also installed the rtl_433 utility with HomeBrew and quickly found that it captured the Oregon Scientific sensor messages quite easily:

```

```

After that, I plugged into the Raspberry Pi and was able to do the same after installing the `rtl_433` package for Ubuntu. So far so good.

I then Googled for HomeAssistant integrations and found this [add-on](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/home-assistant-add-on-rtl-433-with-mqtt-auto-discovery/260665). The problem with that is that I run HomeAssistant Core as a Docker container, so I can't install add-ons. Not an issue, though, because there is more than one way to do it.

# MQTT Broker

HomeAssistant is able to integrate many different sensor events via an [MQTT Sensor Platform](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/sensor.mqtt/). The sensors send messaages to the broker, each under its own "topic", and HomeAssistant can pick them up from there. Eclipse-Mosquitto seems to be the message broker of choice for Linux. I found that it has a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto). So I went ahead and installed it on the Raspberry Pi as follows.

```
mkdir mosquitto
cd mosquitto
mkdir data
mkdir log
```

Here I also created a config file:

```
cvicente@berry:~/mosquitto$ cat mosquitto.conf
persistence true
persistence_location /mosquitto/data/
log_dest file /mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log
```

And then created a docker-compose file:

```
cvicente@berry:~/mosquitto$ cat docker-compose.yaml
version: '3'

services:
  mosquitto:
    image: eclipse-mosquitto
    volumes:
      - ./mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf
      - ./data:/mosquitto/data
      - ./log:/mosquitto/log
    network_mode: host
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 1883:1883
      - 9001:9001
```

Finally, I started it:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

# rtl_433 as a service

The next step was to run the rtl_433 as a system service on the Pi, and configure it to send its messages to the broker. This was also quite easy.

First, the config file:

```
cvicente@berry:~/mosquitto$ cat /etc/rtl_433.conf

protocol 50  # Oregon Scientific (OSv1) Temp Sensor
output mqtt://localhost:1883
convert si
report_meta newmodel
```

Then, I created a systemd service config like this:

```
cvicente@berry:~/mosquitto$ cat /etc/systemd/system/rtl_433.service
[Unit]
Description=433MHz receiver on DVB stick
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
ExecStart=/usr/bin/rtl_433 -c /etc/rtl_433.conf

RestartSec=0
Restart=always
RemainAfterExit=no

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

And then enabled it so that it would start automatically at boot time:

```
sudo systemctl enable rtl_433
```

And then started it:

```
sudo systemctl start rtl_433
```

I waited a bit, and then checked that the messages were actually going to the broker:

```
$ mosquitto_sub -t "rtl_433/berry/events" -v
rtl_433/berry/events {"time":"2021-12-29 10:40:47","brand":"OS","model":"Oregon-v1","id":14,"channel":1,"battery_ok":0,"temperature_C":2.5,"mic":"CHECKSUM"}
rtl_433/berry/events {"time":"2021-12-29 10:40:47","brand":"OS","model":"Oregon-v1","id":14,"channel":1,"battery_ok":0,"temperature_C":2.5,"mic":"CHECKSUM"}
```

Yay! It worked.

# HomeAssistant Integration

The next step was to install the MQTT integration into HomeAssistant. For that, I went to `Configuration -> Integrations -> Add Integration` in the HomeAssistant UI. I searched
for MQTT and installed it. In the configuration, I entered:

```
Broker: localhost
Port: 1883
```

I didn't use authentication because this is all local, after all.

As a test, I entered `rtl_433/berry/events` under `Listen to a topic`, and voilá, the messages were coming in.

The next step was to configure a sensor. In the HomeAssistant config file, I added:

```
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Outside Temperature"
    state_topic: "rtl_433/berry/events"
    unit_of_measurement: "°C"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.temperature_C }}"
```

After restarting HomeAssistant, I was able to add the sensor to the dashboard.

Not too bad. I expected this to be more complicated, and it wasn't.

Cheers.
