It's been a while since I've been thinking about playing with a Raspberry Pi at home. A recent conversation with my friend Martin made me decide
to go ahead and order one. 

After looking at different options, I decided to buy [this one from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TC2BK1X/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_ZRSNFbDCJW6R2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1).
It's going to be look pretty in this [Ingers alluminium case](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087TZ1XKZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
I also bought a [2-pack of Pioneer 64GB SD cards](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X4CH2DF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). They were the best deal as far as I could tell.  

I'm thinking about some home projects that I will share on this blog later.
