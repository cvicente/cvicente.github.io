I'm setting up this blog to share technical information with others. This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
and [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages)
I really like this solution because it's simple and minimalist.

Stay tuned for upcoming content.

Happy Halloween!
