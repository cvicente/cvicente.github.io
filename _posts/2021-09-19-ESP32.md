About ten months since my last post. Wow. That doesn't mean that I haven't been doing anything fun, though. 
Let's start by sharing how I set up [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) on 
[my RPI](https://cvicente.github.io/raspberry_pi/2020/11/01/RASPBERRY-PI.html), and how I added my first few integrations.

The RPI runs Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS. For HomeAssistant, I decided to use their Docker container with docker-compose, 
[as explained in their docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/linux#docker-compose). 
That was quite easy, but I learned a couple of things:

* The configuration can be managed either entirely via a YAML file, or entirely via the UI, or a combination of both. 
This is fine, except for the fact that the documentation is not very clear. Furthermore, if you want to start 
with a minimal YAML file, the docs don't provide one. They only link to a bunch of advanced configurations on people's 
Github repos. That's only useful _after_ you know what you are doing.

* If you run HomeAssistant on Docker, you cannot use the Add-Ons feature. Fortunately you can still run extra 
tools as Docker containers, as I'll mention later.

## Smart Switches
Once HA was set up and running, the first thing that I wanted to integrate was my [Kasa Smart Light Switch HS200](https://www.kasasmart.com/us/products/smart-switches/kasa-smart-wi-fi-light-switch-hs200), which I use to automate my
front-door lights. HomeAssistant discovered it automatically. Nice. That would have been enough, but I wanted to 
disable the automation on the proprietary app, and add the automation in HomeAssistant. I did this via the HA UI, 
following [these instructions](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/editor/), but the resulting YAML file 
looks like this:

```
$ cat home-assistant/config/automations.yaml
- id: '1631480337727'
  alias: Turn Front Lights On at Sunset
  description: ''
  trigger:
  - platform: sun
    event: sunset
  condition: []
  action:
  - service: switch.turn_on
    target:
      area_id: front_door
  mode: single
- id: '1631481707592'
  alias: Turn Front Lights off at Sunrise
  description: ''
  trigger:
  - platform: sun
    event: sunrise
  condition: []
  action:
  - service: switch.turn_off
    target:
      entity_id: switch.front_door_lights
	  mode: single
```

Now I have a switch card on the HA dashboard, and the automations work as expected. Win.

## Temperature and humidity sensors

I wanted to track temperature and humidity in each floor. There are a number of nice products out there for this purpose, 
but I wanted to go the DIY way because it's cheaper and more fun. I found [this video](https://youtu.be/l5ea7lQWpMk) 
quite helpful (thank you, Chris). So I went ahead and ordered:

* Two [ESP-WROOM-32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/modules/esp32) units. Available from eBay or Amazon for under $9. There are many versions of these boards, 
but these appear to work well.
* Three [Xiaomi Mijia LED Bluetooth Thermometer Hygrometer](https://xiaomi-mi.com/sockets-and-sensors/mijia-temperature-and-humidity-monitor-2/). 
Also available from eBay or Amazon at the surprising price of 3 for $20.

The ESP32 is basically a microprocessor with WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities. They integrate well with HA via 
the [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) tool.

The Xiaomi thermometers use [Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) technology, 
which I didn't know anything about until now. They send measurements to paired devices (in this case the ESP32 units).

The video I linked above pretty much covers it all. The only difference in my case is that I run esphome on its own
docker container using docker-compose:

```
version: '3'

services:
  esphome:
    image: esphome/esphome
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config:rw
      # Use local time for logging timestamps
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    network_mode: host
    restart: always
```

I used the [command-line instructions](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_command_line.html) for creating and 
modifying the YAML files to control the ESP32s. Once created and modified, each ESP32's YAML file looks like this
(secrets removed):

```
esphome:
  name: livingroom
  platform: ESP32
  board: nodemcu-32s

# Enable logging
logger:

# Enable Home Assistant API
api:
  password: ""

ota:
  password: ""

wifi:
  ssid: my-ssid
  password: xxxx

  # Enable fallback hotspot (captive portal) in case wifi connection fails
  ap:
    ssid: "Livingroom Fallback Hotspot"
    password: xxxx

captive_portal:

esp32_ble_tracker:

sensor:
  - platform: xiaomi_lywsd03mmc
    mac_address: "A4:C1:38:F8:A4:F5"
    bindkey: "xxxx"
    temperature:
      name: "Livingroom Temperature"
    humidity:
      name: "Livingroom Humidity"
    battery_level:
      name: "Livingroom Battery Level"
```

## Humidity alert

We run a dehumidifier in the basement. In order to check that it's running properly, I set up an
[alert in HA](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/alert) to alert us if the humidity goes above 60%.

### Notifications

Before doing that, I had to set up a notification method. I wanted to send an SMS to myself and my wife. There are
commercial options for that, but I went with the [SMTP integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/smtp/)
using Gmail. Instead of using my main Gmail credentials, I created an application-specific password, as suggested
in the HA docs.

### SMTP

The relevant section in `configuration.yaml` looks like this:

```
notify:
  - name: "SMTP"
    platform: smtp
    server: "smtp.gmail.com"
    port: 587
    timeout: 15
    sender: "my-address@gmail.com"
    encryption: starttls
    username: "my-address@gmail.com"
    password: "xxxxx"
    recipient:
      - "my-address@gmail.com"
      - "5555555555@txt.att.net"
      - "6666666666@txt.att.net"
    sender_name: "HomeAssistant"
```

### iPhone app

There's an [iPhone app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/home-assistant/id1099568401) for HomeAssistant. 
You have the option to provide internal (from within the home WiFi) and external URLs. It's fun to turn on and off 
the lights from within your phone, but it's also a way to receive notifications from HA.

### Automation for the Alert

I set up the alert by going to `Configuration -> Automations` and used both notification methods above. The config
in `automations.yaml` looks like this:

```
- id: '1632093262507'
  alias: Alert High Basement Humidity
  description: ''
  trigger:
  - platform: numeric_state
    entity_id: sensor.basement_humidity_2
    above: '60'
    attribute: unit_of_measurement
  condition: []
  action:
  - service: notify.mobile_app_cv_iphone
    data:
      message: Basement Humidity High
      title: Basement Humidity High
  - service: notify.smtp
    data:
      message: Basement Humidity High
      title: Basement Humidity High
  mode: single
```

I tested it with the "Run Actions" option within the Automation configuration page, and it all worked as expected. Yay.

## Dashbaard

My dashboard now has these cool graphs:
